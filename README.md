## Description

*AMCL - Apache Milagro Crypto Library*

AMCL is a standards compliant C cryptographic library with no external dependencies, specifically designed to support the Internet of Things (IoT).

For a detailed explanation about this library please read: [doc/AMCL.pdf](doc/AMCL.pdf)

AMCL is provided in *C* language but includes a *[Python](https://www.python.org)* and *[GO](https://golang.org)* wrapper.

NOTE: This product includes software developed at *[The Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/)*.

## Software Dependencies

In order to build this library, the following packages are required:

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is required to build the source code.
* [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.8/), the C Foreign Function Interface for Python is required in order to execute tests.
* [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org) is required to build the source code documentation.
* [GO](https://golang.org/dl/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) languages are required to build the language wrappers.
* Please refer to the *resources/DockerDev/Dockerfile* file for any additional dependency.


The above packages can be installed in different ways, depending on the Operating System used:

* **Debian/Ubuntu Linux**


    sudo apt-get install -y git cmake build-essential python python-dev python-pip libffi-dev doxygen doxygen-latex parallel
    sudo pip install cffi


* **RedHat/CentOS/Fedora Linux**


    sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries"
    sudo yum install -y git cmake python libpython-devel python-pip libffi-devel doxygen doxygen-latex parallel
    sudo pip install cffi


* **MacOs**


    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    brew install cmake
    brew install pkg-config libffi
    sudo pip install cffi
    brew install doxygen
    brew install parallel


* **Windows**
    * Minimalist GNU for Windows [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) provides the tool set used to build the library and should be installed
    * When the MinGW installer starts select the **mingw32-base** and **mingw32-gcc-g++** components
    * From the menu select *"Installation"* &rarr; *"Apply Changes"*, then click *"Apply"*
    * Finally add *C:\MinGW\bin* to the PATH variable
    * pip install cffi
    * install CMake following the instructions on http://www.cmake.org
    * install Doxygen following the instructions on http://www.doxygen.org


## Build Instructions

#### Linux and Mac

##### Quick start

As Makefile is present at the project root that reads the options defined in
config.mk. Change these options and then type  ```make``` to build and test
the library.

If you have docker installed then type ```make dbuild``` to build and test
the library in a docker container.

##### Manual build

NOTE: The default build is for 64 bit machines

    git clone https://github.com/miracl/milagro-crypto-c
    cd milagro-crypto-c
    mkdir -p target/build
    cd target/build
    cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/amcl ../..
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./
    make
    make test
    make doc
    sudo make install

On Debian/Ubuntu machine instead of executing the *"sudo make install"* command it is possible to execute *"sudo checkinstall"* to build and install a DEB package.

Now you can set the path to where libs and python package are installed:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./:/opt/amcl/lib
    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

NOTE: The build can be configured by setting flags on the command line, for example:

    cmake -DAMCL_CHUNK=64 ../..
    cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/amcl -D AMCL_CHUNK=64 -D BUILD_WCC=on ../..

To list other available CMake options, use:

    cmake -LH

##### Uninstall software

    sudo make uninstall

##### Building an installer 

After having built the libraries you can build a binary installer and a source distribution by running this command

    make package


#### Windows

Start a command prompt as an administrator

    git clone https://github.com/miracl/milagro-crypto-c
    cd milagro-crypto-c
    mkdir target\build
    cd target\build
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..\..
    mingw32-make
    mingw32-make test
    mingw32-make doc
    mingw32-make install

Post install append the PATH system variable to point to the install ./lib:

*My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced > Environment Variables*

The build can be configured using by setting flags on the command line i.e.

    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -D BUILD_PYTHON=on ..

##### Uninstall software

    mingw32-make uninstall

##### Building an installer

After having built the libraries you can build a Windows installer using this command

    sudo mingw32-make package

In order for this to work NSSI has to have been installed


## Contributions

This project includes a Makefile that allows you to test and build the project in a Linux-compatible system with simple commands.  
All the artifacts and reports produced using this Makefile are stored in the *target* folder.  

All the packages listed in the *resources/DockerDev/Dockerfile* file are required in order to build and test all the library options in the current environment. Alternatively, everything can be built inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container using the command "make dbuild".

To see all available options:
```
make help
```

To build the project inside a Docker container (requires Docker):
```
make dbuild
```

To build a particular set of options inside a Docker container:
```
MAKETARGET='build TYPE=LINUX_64BIT_NIST256_RSA2048' make dbuild
```
The list of pre-defined options can be listed by typing ```make help```


The base Docker building environment is defined in the following Dockerfile:
```
resources/DockerDev/Dockerfile
```

To execute all the default test builds and generate reports in the current environment:
```
make qa
```

To format the code (please use this command before submitting any pull request):
```
make format
```

## Useful Docker commands

To manually create the container you can execute:
```
docker build --tag="miracl/amcldev" .
```

To log into the newly created container:
```
docker run -t -i miracl/amcldev /bin/bash
```

To get the container ID:
```
CONTAINER_ID=`docker ps -a | grep miracl/amcldev | cut -c1-12`
```

To delete the newly created docker container:
```
docker rm -f $CONTAINER_ID
```

To delete the docker image:
```
docker rmi -f miracl/amcldev
```

To delete all containers
```
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

To delete all images
```
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```
